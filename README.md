# earthquake-viewer
Javascript (ES6) web application that allows you to view recent earthquake activity.

Exercise to learn more about the ES6 feature additions. Also, to learn better
file/folder organization and to build as minimally as possible.

Very barebones application. To view, open `index.html` in any browser that
supports ES6. You can check if your browser is compatible [here](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/).
